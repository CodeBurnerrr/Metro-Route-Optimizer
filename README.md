# Metro-Route-Optimizer
Welcome to the Metro Route Optimizer repositoryâ€”a Python application that computes the shortest path between metro stations using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

## Overview
The Metro Route Optimizer is a Python-based application designed to efficiently calculate the shortest routes within metro networks across various cities. This flexible system dynamically constructs adjacency matrices, allowing for easy adaptations to different metro systems.

## Features
1. Shortest Path Calculation: Implements Dijkstra's Algorithm for efficient route finding.
2. Flexible Metro System Design: Accommodates metro networks from multiple cities.
3. Dynamic Adjacency Matrix Construction: Automatically builds adjacency matrices for various metro stations.

## Installation
 ### Prerequisites:
 1. Python (3.8 or above recommended)
 2. pip (Python package installer)

 ### Steps:
 1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/CodeBurnerrr/Metro-Route-Optimizer.git
    ```
 2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd Metro-Route-Optimizer
    ```
 
## Usage
1. Start the application by running:
  ```
  python main.py
  ```
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose a city and source station.
3. The application will compute and display the shortest paths to all other stations.
